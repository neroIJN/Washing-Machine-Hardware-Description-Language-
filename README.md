# Washing-Machine-Hardware-Description-Language-
This project implements a machine (or system) using Hardware Description Language (HDL) with Verilog, focusing on a behavioral modeling approach. In this model, the machine's functionality is described in terms of high-level behavior and logic, without explicitly detailing the underlying hardware structure.
