# Washing-Machine-Hardware-Description-Language-
This project implements a machine (or system) using Hardware Description Language (HDL) with Verilog, focusing on a behavioral modeling approach. In this model, the machine's functionality is described in terms of high-level behavior and logic, without explicitly detailing the underlying hardware structure.

Key features of the project:

Behavioral Modeling: The functionality of the machine is described using high-level constructs such as if, case, and always blocks, which define the system's behavior in a more abstract form.
Verilog Syntax: Written in Verilog, this project follows the syntax and conventions used for digital design, enabling simulation and synthesis for FPGA or ASIC implementations.
Machine Functionality: The machine can be extended or modified to implement different operations and logic based on the behavior outlined in the code.
This project serves as a foundational example of how complex systems can be modeled in Verilog using behavioral descriptions.
